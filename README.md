## 🗺️ Milestone 1: Core AI Production Engine

For the first milestone, the strategy deliberately avoids databases and frontend development. Instead, the focus is on building a robust backend capable of processing a complete episode purely from the command line or through simple API calls.

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] **Build the Project Directory Manager:** Establish the foundational file structure and management system.
- [ ] **Create Provider Abstractions:** Implement standardized interfaces for all generative models, including:
  - LLMs
  - Image generators
  - Audio generators
  - Video generators
- [ ] **Implement Core Services:** Develop the `Narrative`, `Script`, `Audio`, `Image`, and `Video` services. Ensure each service follows a standardized I/O pattern by reading from an `input/` directory and writing to an `output/` directory.
- [ ] **Add a Job Manager:** Create a tracking system that records every execution and its associated metadata.
- [ ] **Expose API Endpoints:** Wrap each service in **FastAPI** endpoints to enable seamless triggering and testing using tools like Swagger UI or Postman.

### 🏗️ Architectural Vision

Once these steps are complete, the foundation will serve as a robust, standalone AI production engine. 

Building the **Next.js** dashboard afterward becomes a much cleaner process: it will strictly be a matter of visualizing projects, jobs, and assets, rather than mistakenly embedding heavy business logic into the frontend. This decoupled architecture ensures the application remains highly extensible as new AI providers and production stages are added in the future.
